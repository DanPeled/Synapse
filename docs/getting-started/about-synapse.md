{% hint style="info" %}
Synapse refers to the complex process by which the brain's visual system utilizes synapses, the connections between neurons, to analyze and interpret visual information. This processing begins in the retina, with the first synapses forming between photoreceptors and downstream neurons, and extends to higher brain areas like the occipital lobe, the brain's visual processing center.
